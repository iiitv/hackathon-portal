        <h2>What is Hackathon / HackIIITV? </h2>
    </div>
    <p>A Hackathon is any event of any duration where people come together to solve problems.
        There is given a set of Problems to the team. Team has to give solution of the problem. it may be idea of the
        problem or implementation like app, web based etc. within the duration. HackIIITV is not just a coding contest
        rather, its notion is to get the most effective solutions to real-life problems. It is a team-based event in
        which
        each team is given a problem set consisting of real-life problems and the teams have to come up with a practical
        solution for the same. The teams have to fabricate programs to implement their ideas & also present it, however
        complex it is, to the judges. All of this has to be done within a period of 24 hours, so your management,
        team-work,
        and planning skills matter here. As you can see HackIIITV is a blend of programming, creative thinking, time
        management and presentation skills,</p>
